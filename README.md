## About the theme
This is a website built with Jekyll, an open source static website generator. Its theme, Jekyll Academic, was developed at NCSU Libraries, and it is largely based on Minimal Mistakes, a theme by Michael Rose.

It provides a simple, well designed website, optimized for hosting on Github pages and it reduces the technological know-how and time that is usually required for maintenance.
