[Here is a Log](https://ss4ws.github.io/blog/2018/learning-log/) to help students record their daily progress and discover patterns in their learning over time. It is designed for my FREN 1050 students this semester, but it can take many iterations. My inspiration for this kind of daily self-tracking comes from [Feltron's Annual Reports](http://feltron.com/FAR14.html). Thanks to Professor Karen James for the help!
