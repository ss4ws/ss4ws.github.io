After a year at the [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org/) as part of the [Praxis Program Fellowship](http://scholarslab.org/praxis-program-fellowships/), I will be back to [my home department](http://french.as.virginia.edu/) this Fall 2018, teaching two sections of accelerated French for beginners (FREN 1050). [See calendar & lesson planning here](https://ss4ws.github.io/blog/2018/fall-calendar/).👨🏻‍🏫
