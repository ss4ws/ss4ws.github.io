I am humbled and honored to receive an [All-University Graduate Students Teaching Award 2017-18](https://gradstudies.virginia.edu/node/426). My friends Candace (Sociology) and Ross (Politics) received one too. Hooray. üôå

The ceremony took place at the Pavilion VII (Colonnade Club) where I was in good company with Professors Gary Ferguson, (current chair of the French Department), Amy Ogden, Karen James, and Alison Levine.

This award wouldn't have been possible without Karen James (Director of the Language Program) and Amy Ogden (Director of Graduate Studies) nomination and support.

A very special thanks to them and to the committee for selecting me.

My infinite gratitude and appreciation goes out to all those in the French Department at UVa (Faculty and students) who are being a constant inspiration for me. I feel privileged to be part of such a collegiate learning and teaching community.
