I successfully defended my dissertation via Zoom today. My friend Aidyn-Lorraine who attended the defense heard my advisor Ari Blatt saying that I had written a "dynamite dissertation." Later that day, she surprised me with a chocolate cake; she had pasted this sign on the box. I am so grateful to my committee, friends, and family who supported me throughout this project.
