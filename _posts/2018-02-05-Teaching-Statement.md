One of my most meaningful learning experiences came from my first French teacher. On the first day of class for absolute beginners, she stood at the door, said something in French, and walked out, leaving behind her a nebula of question marks. The class’s puzzlement only started to dissipate when we turned to each other for explanation. Eventually, we found her in another classroom, smiling and inviting us to take a seat (in French). In that simple exercise, she set the tone for the experience to come. Learning begins with confusion and curiosity, full immersion naturally forces collaboration, and understanding rarely comes from linguistic cues only, but by putting together pieces from a larger context.

The quest for meaning is rooted within us. So is the language by which we ask questions. In language learning, however, the object we are seeking and the means by which we are seeking it, overlap. If learning starts by clearing the view from all that remains opaque, then liberating the mind from one’s own assumptions and presuppositions is a crucial step in the learning process and meaning-making. I believe that foreign  language learning provides this training through paraphrase. Paraphrasing pushes for an important internal negotiation, a rehashing and rearranging of old materials to form new meanings.

Montaigne, the skeptic French writer, famously compressed both the desire for knowledge and the method of acquiring it in one simple question: “Que sais-je ?” (“What do I know?”) Adopting the humble position of not knowing allows the learner to move forward, under the guidance and supervision of the teacher. Moreover, by coming back to the same question frequently, reflecting on the distance traveled, and contemplating the road ahead, progress is made and the learner is rewarded with the empowerment to take the journey on their own.

Reinforcing Montaigne’s “Que sais-je” technique is built-in with e-portfolios, because reflection has been identified as one of their main virtues. Combining it with the particularities of language learning, e-portfolios hit a neuralgic spot. They become students’ companions to explore both another culture and their own learning strategies. Students in French quickly realize their limits. The “language barrier” is visible –only a few words and expressions away from them. My challenge as a teacher is to avoid giving them easy passes to the other side by answering their most frequent question: “Comment dit-on… ?” (“How do we say…?”) My goal is to sustain their interest in conquering new ground independently. For that reason, I ask them to paraphrase and reflect.

Beyond any linguistic competencies required to successfully complete the class, the abilities to paraphrase and reflect are the two skills I want my students to take away from my class. Herein lies the beauty of learning a new language. For not only does it trigger the mind to think anew, but also to think on how it does so. Learning a new language is an opportunity for self-discovery and self-realization and I stand in front of my students as a living example of that.
