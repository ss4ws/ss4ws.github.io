### Abstract 
A number of current literary projects of French literature are published in the
format of ABC-books. Why has this format, related to the learning of reading,
become so popular today? In a society dominated by electronic apparatuses
and pervasive technologies, is it imperative to relearn how to read and write? In
this article, I attempt to answer these questions by looking at two recent
publications (2014) by authors Francois Bon and Eric Chevillard who are also
known for their online presence and their appropriation of new communicative
tools for their own creative purposes. With the use of free, textual analysis
software, such as Voyant Tools, I seek to explore the centrality of the
confessional-autobiographical modalities in these ABC-book projects arguing
that the “abandonment” to an aleatory navigation based on serendipity
constitutes their guiding principle.
