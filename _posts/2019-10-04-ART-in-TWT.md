title: Attention & Reflection Tracking; The role of micro-refection in e-portfolios.
date: 2019-10-04 15:28:06
modified: 
excerpt: Attention & Reflection Tracking (ART) is an innovative use of google forms for students to collect data about themselves over the course a semester. This presentation discusses the use of the collected data to promote deeper reflection in the construction of e-portfolios. The data generated is not only used for their statistical value but also as a source for creative visualizations for metacognitive learning.

#### 1. A tracker

#### 3. A metacognitive tool

<figcaption><small>My visual reflection serves as a great metaphor for how this class went for me. [...] my personal rating of academic performance fluctuated greatly, as did my meditation. There were many days where I became greatly frustrated with my lack of confidence in my French speaking [...] I was ultimately left with an image that I find to be very beautiful and floral, even though my experience in this class was fairly volatile. I do feel as though I experienced growth through this course, even though my reflections were not visibly increasing in quality. The experience, as represented by the image, was still a beautiful one.</small></figcaption>

#### Quantified Self *vs* ART 

- Quantified self: self-knowledge through numbers 
  => self-optimization (healthier, stronger etc)

- ART: self-writing through numbers 
  => mindfulness (honesty and acceptance of oneself)

#### What is an ePortfolio?

<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">“Authentic, Experiential, Evidence-based Learning” (AAEEBL)</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">A type (genre) of website focused on the author (autobiographical website)</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Documentation through digital artefacts</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Multimodal representation of evidence</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Reflective self-assessment</p>

---

#### Why is it difficult to adopt in teaching?
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Steep learning curve</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Process/product divide</p>

---

#### In what way does ART help solve the problem?  
##### Our hypothesis:
If students:
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Engage in reflection at the granular level</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Engage in reflection on a regular basis</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Without the stress of high stakes assessment</p>
They will:
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Develop the habit of reflection</p>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Produce enigmatic/artistic artefacts for reflection</p>

#### Materialization 
Ways of interpreting data in various physical forms
1. Embroidery 
2. 3D printing 
3. Letter press printing 
4. Laser cutting 
5. Wood etching 

---

#### Going forward...
Better integration with ePortfolio platform
