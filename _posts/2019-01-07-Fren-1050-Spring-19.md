### A few recommendations about e-mails: 

- Before you send an email make sure the information you are requesting is not already available to you (i.e. Syllabus, Collab announcements, etc).  
- Often times students have similar questions and concerns. Coordinate with your classmates and ask these questions in class for the benefit of the group.
- Face-to-face communication after class, or a visit during office hours, immensely decrease the amount of time and energy spent on emails, on both ends. 
- An email is not instant communication. No matter how urgent it is for you, a response might require a considerable time lag. Be mindful of what you are asking and when. If it can wait, keep it for the class.
