### A.R.T (Attention & Reflection Tracker)
#### From the gross to the subtle

- Preparation 
- Attention 
- Contribution 
  - Usage of French language  
- Meditation

---

### Quantified Self *vs* A.R.T 

- Quantified self: self-knowledge through numbers => self-optimization (healthier, stronger etc)
- A.R.T.: self-writing through numbers => mindfulness (honesty and acceptance of oneself)

---

### A.R.T principles

1. Process *vs* Outcome
2. Inscription *vs* Measurement
3. Reflection *vs* Value Judgement

<figcaption><small>My visual reflection serves as a great metaphor for how this class went for me. This course was very difficult for me. As can be seen from my image, my personal rating of academic performance fluctuated greatly, as did my meditation (the dotted line in the center). There were many days where I became greatly frustrated with my lack of confidence in my French speaking and in turn, this resulted in a distracted meditation. However, the days in which I understood the concepts we were learning were days of great satisfaction for me, thus the spikes in my image. I was ultimately left with an image that I find to be very beautiful and floral, even though my experience in this class was fairly volatile. I do feel as though I experienced growth through this course, even though my reflections were not visibly increasing in quality. The experience, as represented by the image, was still a beautiful one.</small></figcaption>

<figcaption><small>My graph shows a consistent path through French 1050, I contributed in class, did my homework, attended class and arrived on time. However, the graph the did not show my struggles with remembering the material,throughout the semester I discovered better ways to study the material. I began to review the homework assignments and came up with ways to remember how to form the verb tenses. I think that the consistency helped me develop the tools I used to improve. The meditations was not that helpful overall, I think that was attributed to the fact that I frequently had other things on my mind. During the meditations these thoughts would start to cycle through my mind, not allowing me to relax. I am interested in how thought processes aid personal growth, but I am not sure if I will continue meditation.</small></figcaption>
