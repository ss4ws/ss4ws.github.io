# Introductions 

Hi everybody! Let me introduce myself. My name is Spyridon (Spyros) Simotas and I am a PhD student here at the University of Virginia. I am working on an overdue dissertation on three contemporary French authors who publish online: François Bon, Éric Chevillard and Philippe De Jonckheere. 

Given that the web has completely eroded boundaries between producer and consumer, between form and content, but also between artistic disciplines, I am looking the websites of these three authors, as an expression of new poetic hybrids. 

My research happens at the intersection of critical theory (especially the late Roland Barthes), of avant-gardes movements (especially Oulipo and more specifically Georges Perec), and Digital Humanities. 

By the way, starting this year a new Digital Humanities track and Certificate will be offered to Graduate students in Arts and Sciences. As part of my own training in Digital Humanities, I was a Praxis Fellow last year, where I worked collaboratively with five other graduate students on an Augmented Reality project. It’s called UVA Reveal, and it connects archival documents from our library with physical spaces on Grounds. I am particularly proud to say that one of the augmented locations is the Department of French. If you have an android phone or tablet, I encourage you to download the app from our website and offer yourself an alternative tour of Grounds. You will find the link on my website, or at the posters you’ll see plastered on the hallway.

Voilà. That’s enough of me for now. Let’s go around and hear a little bit about you. 
 
# Vocabulary in Context 

Before I start I should say that my intention is to have a dialogue with you, take this as an opportunity to start sharing ideas, comparing methods and learn from each other. 

Some of you may have never taught before and are probably feeling very stressed right now –who doesn’t actually? Luckily, Professor Karen James is making everything possible to provide you with the necessary teaching resources and the moral support you need to succeed. 

You are not alone. We are all part of the same team of French language instructors. Our individual work reflects back to the team and vice-versa. We are all here to learn and grow and pass our love for the French language and culture to our students. We are all different, with different individual interests and strengths, but we can all make a difference in our students’ lives. 

Questions so far? 

Alright, and now to the presentation. My presentation is divided in two parts: 
1. In the first two thirds of my presentation I am building an argument around the notion of “context” through a collection of quotes, from surrealism to information theory.  
2. In the last third of my presentation I am talking about concrete teaching examples from the books we are using. 

## 1. The dictionary 
When I think of vocabulary, I think of the dictionary. Why don’t we teach vocabulary _with_ the dictionary? Say, assign a few pages to students every day to learn by heart and then move to a few more pages and so on. Is vocabulary compatible with the dictionary? A dictionary after all offers the more comprehensive view of any given language. Why we don't give a few pages each day to students to learn by heart? 

## 2. Use of the dictionary  
A dictionary has very specific uses. None of these are helpful in teaching vocabulary in a foreign language class. The presentation of the words on the dictionary reflects the affordances of its medium –the codex. 

- The alphabetical order, despite its usefulness, it flattens the language. Unless we have a familiarity with the language already we can’t really say by looking the words on a dictionary which are the most commonly used one and consequently the ones we want our students to learn first. 

- The dictionary lacks context. There is no specific grouping of words together. 

- There are of course playful uses of the dictionary too. We can use the dictionary in a serendipitous mode, jumping around reading and learning about words that we are not familiar with. From my limited exposure to foreign language learning apps, that’s what I have realized. The app put random but grammatically correct words together. But because they are so out of context the retention rate is very low. “La fille porte une robe verte.” Being able to align correctly a few words together in the target language doesn’t make anyone able to communicate with a native speaker. 

- Now, don’t get me wrong, I use the dictionary all the time. Whether it is to check the definition or the spelling of a word or to find a synonym. The dictionary is thus a reference document not a learning instrument.

## 3. Endangered Species 

These days, dictionaries in their printed format are “endangered species” if not already extinct. Do you own a dictionary? Do you use online dictionaries? My favorite French dictionary online is the _Dictionnaire Vivant de la Langue Française_ a joint effort between the University of Chicago and the ATILF (Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la Langue Française). The reason I find it extremely useful is because it aggregates entries from many traditional dictionaries and it offers a clear layout with “synonyms”, “antonyms”, “collocations”, and “mots associés” on the same page. “Collocations”, and “mots associés” are bringing us closer to the notion of context. 

## 4. Les associations des mots 

Let’s see what says André Breton about the words : 
> Les mots sont sujets à se grouper selon des affinités particulières, lesquelles ont généralement pour effet de leur faire recréer à chaque instant le monde sur son vieux modèle. [^1]  

According to Breton, words’ tendency to naturally fall into groups is source of frustration. Surrealism was an effort to break this predictability creating new words associations. However, during the foreign language instruction we want students to take advantage of the natural phenomenon of words associations. As a major part of learning a language is to assimilate and to tap into this natural pool of “phrases toute faites” (set expressions). 

[^1] : André Breton, Point du Jour, Nouv. éd. rev. et corr, Collection Idées (Paris: [Paris] Gallimard [1970], 1970)

## 5. Claude Shannon’s experiment 
Claude Shannon mathematician, and well known as “the father of information age”, has shown evidence that what we knew intuitively is actually true. Applying a certain number of parameters to a random string of letters and spaces and then repeating with more and more parameters over and over again, words started to form. 

## 6. Predictability and Surprise
> We communicate with one another by making ourselves predictable, within certain limits. Put another way, the difference between random nonsense and a recognizable language is the presence of rules that reduce surprise.[^2]

[^2]: Rob Goodman et Jimmy Soni, « How a polymath transformed our understanding of information », <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-a-polymath-transformed-our-understanding-of-information"><em>Aeon</em></a>

Human communication is relying on coded systems. Language is one of these highly coded systems. What separates the native speaker from the foreign language learner is the familiarity with the code. The higher the familiarity with the code the bigger the percentage of redundancy and predictability. The lower the familiarity with the code, the bigger the surprise, or even the nonsense.

## 7. Word networks 
Words are simultaneously part of different networks: 
-	Phonetic: which means that words share similar sounds. 
-	Morphologic: which means that words stem from the same form. 
-	Affective: which has to do with the emotional intensity of a situation. 
-	Semantic: which has to do with the meaning of the words. 

## 8. Definition of context.  
So far, we have mentioned context. We have seen for example that there is a lack of it in the dictionary. We have seen with Breton and Shannon that words associate with each other to form set expressions. A phenomenon of predictability that can be frustrating for the poet, but extremely efficient in human communication. But let’s try to be more concrete. What is context? Can you take a minute with a partner to define context? 

Context is:* “The part of the text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning” 
 “The circumstances in which an event occurs; a setting”.

## 9. Importance of context. 
	How does a native speaker learn words? By placing them into a specific context. When a kid flips through their book _Les animaux de la ferme_ what are the chances they find a giraffe or an elephant? Elephants and giraffes are more likely to be found in the zoo, or a different book: “Les animaux de la jungle.” Same with color learning. Colors are associated to natural elements: rouge comme une tomate, bleu comme l’océan, blanc comme le lait, etc. 

Word groups and associations are not the only ways to approach vocabulary. Songs can also help students memorize words and set expressions plus they help create a little pleasant moment in the classroom. Let’s listen to this one : [Des os](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bChrAwLzoSo). 

Over and over the song repeats the same words and expression which is a very useful technique in the foreign language acquisition. Repetition leads to memorization and consequently to assimilation.   

Let’s conclude then that context is important because:
-	It groups the vocabulary under themes/topics. (i.e. les animaux de la  ferme)
-	It helps find the right word for the right situation. (i.e. commander au restaurant, parler de son avenir)
-	It helps create words associations. (i.e. coffee-break)

## 10. Brouiller l'ordre des mots
Let’s come back to André Breton and his previous quote. 
	« Les mots sont sujets à se grouper selon des affinités particulières, lesquelles ont généralement pour effet de leur faire recréer à chaque instant le monde sur son vieux modèle. Je crois qu'il n'est pas trop tard pour revenir sur cette déception, inhérente aux mots dont nous avons fait jusqu'ici mauvais usage. Qu'est-ce qui me retient de brouiller l'ordre des mots, d'attenter de cette manière à l'existence toute apparente des choses ! »[^3]
[^3] : op. cit.
The frustration that are « les affinités particulières des mots » for the surrealist poet, for us they are a blessing. The poet seeks to create conflict zones within the language and legitimate the logic of the absurd: “La terre est bleue comme une orange”. 
We seek the exact opposite for our students. We are happy when they are able to express themselves in a cohesive, albeit banal manner. 

## 12. L'accouchement de pizza
We are not immune, however, to some “accidental surrealism”. Can you imagine what this student was trying to say? He translated an expression from English to French with the first word he found on the dictionary. 

## 13. Cacophonie 
	« Il y a cacophonie dès qu’il y a confusion ou brouillage des lexiques, sauf à des fins de satire ou quand la dissonance est recherchée en vue d’un effet précis. »[^4]  
[^4] : Éric Chevillard, Le Désordre Azerty, (Paris: Les Éditions de Minuit, 2014). 

## 14. Vocabulary learning with Espace and Imaginez 
Every unit is based on a theme/topic.
-	Espace Context: dedicated to vocabulary
This is the section of the book that I find the most difficult to teach. Flipping the classroom and asking student to come prepared, having studied the vocabulary of the unit at home makes it much easier. 
-	Espace Roman Photo: a simulation of a real-life situation where the vocabulary and grammar of the unit are used. 
This is a section that I particularly appreciate. From the point of view of the native speaker it seems like a slowed down audio. Nevertheless, this is the model of oral French we want our students to replicate. If only I could make them learn each dialogue by heart. 
-	Espace Culture: More vocabulary and cultural awareness. 
Each unit has an assortment of texts related to the topic with various activities. 

## 15. Example Avenir-Métiers 
Espace Contexte Unité 13 - L’avenir et les métiers
Assuming that student have studied the vocabulary the previous night at home. You can start asking them questions. 
-	Où est-ce que nous sommes ? 
-	Quel est le nom de la compagnie ? 
-	Que fait la secrétaire ? Pourquoi elle ne décroche pas le téléphone ? 
-	Est-ce que la directrice des Ressources Humaines est occupée ? 

## 16. Example Espace vert 
Espace Contexte Unité 14 - L’espace vert 
Édouard Manet - Le déjeuner sur l’herbe 
Comparez les deux images.   
Utilisation des structures grammaticales de l'unité : comparatif/superlatif des noms. 
Il y a plus d’arbres dans le tableau de Manet. 
Il y a moins de nourriture dans l’image du livre. 
Il y a plus d’animaux dans l’image du livre. 
Il y a autant d’herbe dans les deux images. 
## 17. Inversez l'ordre du livre
Inversez l'ordre du livre 
Roman photo > Espace Contexte 
Roman Photo - La panne (Espace 11B) 
Après le visionnage demandez aux étudiants s’ils ont des mots inconnus et répondez aux questions Vrai ou Faux.
Revenez à l’espace Contextes et reprenez le vocabulaire avec les exercices. 
## 18. Approfondir le vocabulaire avec espaces cultures 

Approfondir le vocabulaire avec Espace Culture</h4>
Espace Cultures “Les voitures en France” vous pouvez renforcer et enrichir le vocabulaire appris.
[“Il vaut donc mieux avoir une petite voiture économique qui ne consomme pas beacoup d’essence…”]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfi2WWvbnU&list=PL02A53EABD9EA4715&index=20)

Après le visionnage demandez aux étudiants de décrire deux scènes du film.
