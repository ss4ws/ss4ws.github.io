Hi, my name is Spyridon Simotas and I am a PhD candidate in French at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on French contemporary literature and digital media. More precisely, I am looking at the websites of three contemporary French authors identifying the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, materiality of the text, and authorship.

This year, I am also a Praxis program fellow, working alongside five other graduate students and Scholarsâ€™ Lab staff, on an [Augmented Reality project](http://reveal.scholarslab.org/). Our project seeks to connect archival documents residing on the shelves of our libraries to public spaces on UVa Grounds. By overlaying documents over public spaces through augmented reality techniques, we envision an enhanced, more contextualized experience of our surroundings.
