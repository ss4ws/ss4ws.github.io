Today, I had the honor to receive an All-University Graduate Students Teaching Award.

A very special thanks to the committee for selecting me.

This wouldn't have been possible without Professor Karen James (Director of the Language Program) and Professor Amy Ogden (Director of Graduate Studies) who nominated me and supported my nomination.  

I would also like to express my gratitude and appreciation to all the Faculty and students of the French department for being a constant inspiration. Learning and teaching in such a collegiate community is certainly a privilege for me.
