This is a series of ideas for art installation projects.

1.	A happening where a series of blank canvases have famous paintings titles. Visitors are invited to paint the canvas from memory.    

2.	A video installation playing in fast forward mode the process of writing (a novel, an essay, a poem) as it was recorded with a key logger software, installed on a writer's computer.
