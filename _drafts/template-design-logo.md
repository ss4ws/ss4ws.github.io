### Logo
Reveal logo will have a CSS animation
![Image of logo](/images/reveal-logo-in-browser.png)

### Design and project template, Version 1
The landing page is the animation of the logo. Once the animation is over, the page opens up to a map of grounds indicating all the augmented locations. There is also a very brief text about the project and the team. By clicking on each location the visitor is taken to each individual project.

There will be no home button but the logo on top left of the screen to take the visitor back to the map. Also, at the end of each project the visitor will be taken to the map again to chose the next project.

On the project page we will be using the stacking context technique to overlay different media formats (text, video, sound) to create a 3D effect.

### Design and project template, Version 2
The visitor lands on a home page where the logo and a catalogue of the augmented locations are displayed. There is no map but pictures of the augmented locations. The visitor is free to chose how to navigate through projects.

On the project page we will be using the stacking context technique to overlay different media formats (text, video, sound) to create a 3D effect.
