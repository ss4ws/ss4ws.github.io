If you haven’t heard from the Praxis nerds in a while, it’s because “we were experiencing some technical difficulties.” In short, we had our moment of crisis.

Last semester, we put together some ideas for an Augmented Reality project, and submitted it for a poster section to the [DH 2018](https://dh2018.adho.org/en/). Fueled by our enthusiasm to be part of the DH community in Mexico City this summer, and enticed by the possibilities of AR technology, we submitted a somewhat rushed abstract that perfectly portrays the interdisciplinary nature of Praxis Program and the variety of our individual interests.

Reviewer comments came back a couple of weeks ago pointing out some concerns and weaknesses, giving us the opportunity to go back to the drawing board to fine tune our vision. This is where things got a little messy.

We all still care about our project. Our perspectives on the direction it is taking, however, differ. Much of it has to do with our disciplinary backgrounds and the kinds of questions we are trained to ask. our expectations from the Praxis Program, our personal investment in the project, and the group dynamics are also factors.

This post is by a no means a detailed “crash log,” but a personal account in order to identify “cracks” in our unity. At the end, playing with the AR acronym, I offer my own vision for the project.  

### Second thoughts on Unity
Unity is the Augmented Reality software we are using for our project. [Christian posted enthusiastically about it](http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/learning-to-augment-reality/) a few months back, artfully omitting all the bumps in the process. There is no doubt that when everything works well, i.e. during [Arin’s](http://scholarslab.org/people/arin-bennett/) presentation, everyone gets dazzled. It’s a different story when we tried it ourselves at home. Almost none of the groups succeeded in completing their assignment. Our unfamiliarity with Unity, in conjunction with its complexity, only led to confusion and frustration.

Unity is finicky –not to mention it  only properly worked in two out of our six computers. Unity is  ahead of the curve from other similar software, setting industry’s standards. It is basically the MS Word of AR technology. The necessary evil. Despite Unity and MS Word being super ambitious and success, they fail to address a crucial point: user experience. They are more focused on the outcome, the final product, whether it is an augmented reality app or a print document, than the actual process of making it.People who make things take a certain pleasure in the making process, that’s why they choose their tools and materials with care.

A software only serving functionality purposes, focusing on outcome and getting in your way throughout the process of making, reminding you how much more you need master, not only prevents pleasure, but hinders a novice user from even trying. I wonder why we haven't yet conceived software that unfolds like video games. Starting with a stripped-down version for the beginner user which buildsto higher levels by achieving small goals. Level after level more functionalities become available but they are not a nuisance anymore. They are helpful resources to achieve the task at hand.

Back to our Praxis reality, Unity was the first crack in our unity. We are resolved to using it, because it is the leading software in the field and has extensive exporting capabilities. Unity became our necessary evil but also forced our team of six to break into two groups of three. The "Unity camp" and the "web design camp." A division of labor, which also impacted the communication between us.  

### Repairing the world
In light of our reviewers’ comments, we had to break the silence and take a moment to reflect on what  exactly we were trying to do and why. There is no doubt that we all individually, and as part of the team,  want to make a difference. Make things to fix things. But what is so broken out there that needs fixing? Ask two grad students from different disciplines and you’ll get two different answers. Extend the question and the list might never reach an end. That's because we not only tend to see the "cracks" we are conditioned to see, but because the “world is always breaking; it’s in its nature to break.”(Steven J. Jackson,  “Rethinking Repair”, in Tarleton Gillespie, Pablo J. Boczkowski, et Kirsten A. Foot, éd., Media technologies: essays on communication, materiality, and society, Inside technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2014), 223).

Early 20th century philosopher Walter Benjamin's work may then help us frame the question of a fragmented world, as both a dangerous place leading to barbarism and as an opportunity to collect and re-assemble in an endless creative intervention. Benjamin discovered there is often something missing when we experience the world around us, whether due to displacement or the passage of time. He called this contextual dimension "aura". If things seem out of time of place, how can we salvage their historical context, recover their aura?     

### AR: Aura Recovered
I think everybody's on board if I say that our purpose during this year's Praxis Program is to build connections, superimpose elements of our library’s archive to public spaces. I tend to think of these connections as threads running from book pages inside the library to their corresponding places and objects in the outside world. The air is thick with these threads, but unlike electric wires, they remain out of sight and out of mind. On one hand, there is a symbolic network of connections one discovers by studying, and on the other, the physical world where objects seem neatly separated from their context and from other objects in space. Yet, Augmented Reality technology can help us translate the seemingly empty space to what in human anatomy we call _fascia_: the connective tissue of the world.   

Technically, augmentation is a layered superimposition of information between our eyes and an object. Augmentation thickens the space of our perception with content. To be augmented, as with all the previous advancements in technology, will be a new form of being in the world. Connected with databases and the data analysis tools, while maintaining direct contact with our surroundings. In that regard, we are still scratching the surface of AR's pedagogical and creative implications.

Our project seeks to test some of these claims in an attempt to better understand where we are, and what are the things around us. By making UVa Grounds the testing ground of these hypotheses, we hope to offer a more complete picture of what remains silent on the shelves and make visible more of the public spaces than meets the eye. In the process, we may also recover some of the world's lost aura.
