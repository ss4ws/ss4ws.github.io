# [Bonjour tout le monde!](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/golden-record-french-greeting?in=nasa/sets/golden-record-greetings-to-the) 
 
My name is Spyridon (Spyro) Simotas and I teach French courses at the University of Virginia. Â¶ This website is my e-portfolio, and it is a work in progress. I change it often, because I like to experiment with new designs, and I like to keep up with new technologies for generating static websites. The time for an overhaul has come, and a new website will be published soon.
