Hi, my name is Spyridon Simotas and I am a PhD candidate in French at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on French contemporary literature and digital media. More precisely, I am looking at the websites of three contemporary French authors identifying the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, materiality of the text, and authorship.  

On a different note, along with my research the last 5 years, I have developed a daily yoga practice. It has now become part of who I am. My intention is to keep on practicing because the lessons on the mat are truly life lessons in disguise.
