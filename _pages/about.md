Hi, my name is Spyridon Simotas and I am a PhD candidate in French at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on French contemporary literature and digital media. More precisely, I am looking at the websites of three contemporary French authors identifying the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, materiality of the text, and authorship.

On a different note, and in an effort to be more present in the moment, I roll my mat every morning at NGRC. Over the last five years I have developed [a daily yoga practice](https://www.uvacontemplation.org/yoga) that has now become part of who I am. Tuning in with the breath is a way tame the "monkey mind". I intend to keep on practicing because the lessons on the mat are truly life lessons in disguise.
