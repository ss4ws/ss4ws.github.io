# 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻 

Hi, my name is Spyridon (Spyro) Simotas and I am a PhD candidate in French at the and a full time lecturer at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on French contemporary literature and digital media. More precisely, I examine the websites of three contemporary French writers, and I identify the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, materiality of the text, and authorship. ¶ On a different note, over the past 6 years, I have developed a daily yoga practice. I am grateful for what I've learned so far, and I will keep on practicing because the lessons on the mat are truly life lessons.
