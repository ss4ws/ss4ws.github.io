# [Bonjour tout le monde!](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/golden-record-french-greeting?in=nasa/sets/golden-record-greetings-to-the) 
 
My name is Spyridon (Spyro) Simotas and I am a PhD candidate and a full time lecturer in French at the University of Virginia. I enjoy teaching, writing, and being a DH-practitioner. ¶ This website is my e-portfolio and it is a work in progress. It is a place to share relevant information about my projects, to reflect, and to engage with other scholars. I also use it for my teaching. ¶ My current research focuses on contemporary French literature and digital media. More precisely, I examine the websites of three contemporary French writers, and I identify the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, textuality, and authorship. ¶ On a different note, I am also a yoga practitioner. I am grateful for what I've learned so far, and I will keep on practicing because the lessons on the mat are truly life lessons. ¶ I would love to hear from you if you think we could collaborate on a project, or if you found a typo!
