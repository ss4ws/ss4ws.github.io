# 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻 

Hi, my name is Spyridon (Spyro) Simotas and I am a PhD candidate and a full time lecturer in French at the University of Virginia. I enjoy teaching, being a scholar, and a digital humanities practitioner. ¶ This website, is my portfolio and for that reason it is a work in progress. It is a place to share relevant information about my research projects and my teaching, but also a way to engage with the digital humanities community. ¶ My current research focuses on contemporary french literature and digital media. More precisely, I examine the websites of three contemporary French writers, and I identify the ways in which they challenge preconceived notions of publishing, textuality, and authorship. ¶ On a different note, over the past 6 years, I have developed a daily yoga practice. I am grateful for what I've learned so far, and I will keep on practicing because the lessons on the mat are truly life lessons. ¶ Don't hesitate to contact me if you found something interesting or a typo!
