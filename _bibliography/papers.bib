	Abstract = {A number of current literary projects of French literature are published in the format of ABC-books. Why has this format, related to the learning of reading, become so popular today? In a society dominated by electronic apparatuses and pervasive technologies, is it imperative to relearn how to read and write? In this article, I attempt to answer these questions by looking at two recent publications (2014) by authors Fran{\c c}ois Bon and {\'E}ric Chevillard who are also known for their online presence and their appropriation of new communicative tools for their own creative purposes. With the use of free, textual analysis software, such as Voyant Tools, I seek to explore the centrality of the confessional-autobiographical modalities in these ABC-book projects arguing that the ``abandonment'' to an aleatory navigation based on serendipity constitutes their guiding principle.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
